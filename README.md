# 19-PWA-Text-Editor

# Description

This project is an attempt to create/deploy a web text editor that allows users to create code snippets on a single application. This application is intended to be used with or without a stabilized internet connection. When a user doesn't have an established connection, he/she will still have the ability to work on the editor and their work will later be saved once they re-establish the connection, creating & maintaining full application functionality.
